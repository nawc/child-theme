# NAWC TwentySeventeen Child Theme

This repository contains the source code for the default `TwentySeventeen`
child theme used on the [NA Western Cape](https://na.org.za/wc/) website. It
contains custom changes to the
[12 Step Meeting List](https://wordpress.org/plugins/12-step-meeting-list/)
plugin that allows the site to manage a series of meetings that the plugin
currently does not support.

## Installing the Theme

To install this theme go to the [latest release][latest] and scroll
down to the `Assets` section. Within the Assets section you will see a file
called `nawc.zip`. Download this file by clicking on it and then go to
WordPress and install the theme as per normal.
