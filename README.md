# NAWC TwentySeventeen Child Theme

This repository contains the source code for the default `TwentySeventeen`
child theme used on the [NA Western Cape](https://na.org.za/wc/) website. It
contains custom changes to the
[12 Step Meeting List](https://wordpress.org/plugins/12-step-meeting-list/)
plugin that allows the site to manage a series of meetings that the plugin
currently does not support.

## Installing the Theme

To install this theme download the latest [nawc.zip][dist] WordPress zip file
(or by [clicking here][dist]) and go to your WordPress Themes page
(i.e. `/wp-admin/themes.php`) and upload the zip file here. Once uploaded you
will need to activate the theme for the new theme to take effect.

## Changelog
