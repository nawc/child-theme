# Creating Online Only Meetings

This page shows you how to create, or edit, an Online Only Meeting using the child theme and customised meeting list plugin.

## Steps to Create/Edit Online Only Meeting

Whether creating or editing an Online Only meeting the steps are the same.

1. From the `Types` section within the `Meeting Information` tab you need to select the `Location Temporarily Closed` checkbox. Make sure nothing else is selected but this.
2. Make sure that you've added in the Zoom (or Google Meet) link in the `URL` input box in the `Meeting Information` tab.
3. **Optional:** You don't need to add any meeting address information in the `Location Information` tab but if you do, or there is already location information in place, you can leave it as is because the plugin will cross out these details in the respective views.
4. Click the `Publish` or `Update` button once these are complete.

### Visual Demo of the Steps above

## Detail Page View

Once created, the meeting list detail page has a green `Online Only` indicator in the title and the location temporarily closed is also indicated within the meeting information box. The Online Meeting button is activated and the Meeting Address directly below this crossed out as a visual indicator to people that the meeting venue is closed.

## Meeting List Page

The meeting list page will now have a green `Online Meeting` indicator next to the meeting name and all address details for the venue are removed so as to not confuse people when they view the page.
