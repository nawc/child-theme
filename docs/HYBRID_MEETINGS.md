# Creating Hybrid Meetings

This page shows you how to create, or edit, a Hybrid Meeting using the child theme and customised meeting list plugin.

## Steps to Create/Edit Hybrid Meeting

Whether creating or editing a Hybrid the meeting the steps are the same.

1. From the `Types` section within the `Meeting Information` tab you need to select the `Online & In-Person` checkbox. Make sure nothing else is selected but this.
2. Make sure that you've added in the Zoom (or Google Meet) link in the `URL` input box in the `Meeting Information` tab.
3. Ensure that the `Location Information` contains the meeting's address details.
4. Click the `Publish` or `Update` button once these are complete.

### Visual Demo of the Steps above

## Detail Page View

Once created, the meeting list detail page has an orange `Online + In-Person` indicator in the title and says the same under the meeting information. The Online Meeting button is activated and the Meeting Address directly below this is also reflected.
