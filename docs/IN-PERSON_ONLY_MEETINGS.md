# Creating In-Person Only Meetings

This page shows you how to create, or edit, an In-Person Only Meeting using the child theme and customised meeting list plugin.

## Steps to Create/Edit In-Person Only Meeting

Whether creating or editing an In-Person Only meeting the steps are the same.

1. From the `Types` section within the `Meeting Information` tab you need to select the `In-Person` checkbox. Make sure nothing else is selected but this.
2. **Important:** Make sure that there is no Zoom (or Google Meet) links in the `URL` input box in the `Meeting Information` tab. This must be blank for this to work.
3. Ensure that the `Location Information` contains the meeting's address details.
4. Click the `Publish` or `Update` button once these are complete.

### Visual Demo of the Steps above

## Detail Page View

Once created, the meeting list detail page looks like a regular meeting but contains an `In-Person` indicator within the meeting information box. Unlike the [Online][online] or [Hybrid][hybrid] meeting types, there is no Online Meeting button and the Meeting Address is clearly reflected on the page.

## Meeting List Page

The meeting list page doesn't contain any clear indicators but all address details for the venue are displayed.
